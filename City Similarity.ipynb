            "source": "## Introduction\n\nIrvine is the largest city in area in Orange County with 65.61 sq miles, and 3rd largest in population with 212,375 people according to census in 2010. \n\nA number of corporations, particularly in the technology and semiconductor sectors, have their national or international headquarters in Irvine. A lot of them also have office in Bay Area (this analysis will focus on Santa Clara county). During the last couple of years, I had quite a few friends who relocated to Santa Clara county. One big task in the relocation is to find housing, and neighborhood is an important consideration.\n\nThus, I want to start this analysis on the 15 cities in Santa Clara county and find out which one is the most similar to Irvine.\n\n## Data\n\nData used in this analysis mainly inclue:the population and demographic related data from wikipedia pages, together with the venue information from foursquare API.
